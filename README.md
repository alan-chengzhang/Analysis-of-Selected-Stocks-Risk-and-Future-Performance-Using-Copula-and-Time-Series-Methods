# Analysis-of-Selected-Stocks-Risk-and-Future-Performance-Using-Copula-and-Time-Series-Methods
Final Project of GR5261: Statistical Methods in Finance

Brief introduction of the project:

In our project, we try to answer two major concerns when
investors are given selected stocks to construct a portfolio: First,
how risky are they? Second, how will they probably perform in
the future? In the first part of this report, two major risk measures,
Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR (CVaR), are assessed
using copula models. In the second part, the return of stocks are
predicted using time series models, including ARIMA and
ARIMA-GARCH(1,1) model. The whole process of model
selection, diagnostics and relevant tests are performed.

Our dataset is the stock prices of VZ, GOOGL, MSFT from
2010-01-01 to 2018-12-31 and FB from 2012-05-21 to 2018-12-
31 (ever since it was first listed), which are available on Yahoo
Finance. The risk assessment part uses partial of it (2017-01-01
to 2018-12-31) and the time series part uses the whole dataset for
training. Our computer programming is done in R.

I contribute to the majority of the return prediction based on time serise part of this project as well as wrote report and code of that part.
Also, I participated in the risk analysis part.
